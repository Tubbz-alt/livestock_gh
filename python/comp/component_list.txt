Livestock Simple Rain;Simple Rain;VER 0.0.1 | August 2017;Livestock;2 | Rain and Flow;Use this component to calculate the view vectors for a surface. The component takes in hourly weather datasets and calculates the view vector of the surface(s) in question. The view vector is used to determine if, and what hour of the year, the test point is hit by rain. The calculatin method is based on the paper: Ennis, B. J., & Litster, J. D. (1997). A Study of Driving Rain. Knowledge Creation Diffusion Utilization, 20�54.
